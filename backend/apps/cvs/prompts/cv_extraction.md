## Field rules

**name**: Full name of the candidate. Return empty string if unclear.

**experience_years**: Total years of professional experience as a decimal number (e.g. 2.5, 5.0). Estimate from work history if not stated explicitly. Return 0 if unknown.

**seniority**: Integer 0–5 inferred from experience_years, job titles held, and overall career context:
- 0 = Intern / Fresher (0–0.5 yr, or only internships)
- 1 = Junior (0.5–2 yr)
- 2 = Mid-level (2–5 yr)
- 3 = Senior (5–8 yr, or titled "senior" in most recent role)
- 4 = Lead / Principal (8–12 yr, or titled "lead"/"principal"/"staff"/"architect")
- 5 = Manager / Director (12+ yr, or manages a team)

Use experience_years as primary signal, but override with title context when the candidate has a clearly senior title despite fewer years (or vice versa).

**role_category**: Primary technical discipline. One of:
`"backend"`, `"frontend"`, `"fullstack"`, `"mobile"`, `"devops"`, `"data_ml"`, `"data_eng"`, `"qa"`, `"design"`, `"ba"`, `"other"`
- backend: mostly server-side work (APIs, databases, Java/Python/Go/Node services)
- frontend: mostly client-side work (React/Vue/Angular/CSS)
- fullstack: significant experience on both sides
- mobile: iOS / Android / Flutter / React Native
- devops: infrastructure, CI/CD, cloud, SRE
- data_ml: machine learning, data science, AI
- data_eng: data pipelines, ETL, Spark, Airflow, Kafka
- qa: testing, automation, QA
- design: UI/UX, product design
- ba: business analysis, requirements, product analysis
- other: PM, Scrum Master, Technical Writer, etc.

**education**: Highest degree achieved. One of: `"none"`, `"college"`, `"bachelor"`, `"master"`, `"phd"`. Return `"bachelor"` if unclear.

**skills**: Technical skills only (programming languages, frameworks, tools, databases, cloud platforms). Exclude pure soft skills (communication, teamwork) unless they appear as `agile`, `problem_solving`, or `leadership` in the list below. Proficiency 1–5 where 1=beginner, 3=proficient, 5=expert. Infer from context (years used, role seniority, project complexity).

The `name` field MUST be one of the canonical identifiers below — map what you read to the closest match. Omit a skill if nothing in the list fits.

## Important

- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
- Do not include markdown code blocks in your response
- If a field cannot be determined, use the default: empty string for name, 0 for experience_years, 2 for seniority, "bachelor" for education, "other" for role_category, empty arrays for skills and work_experience
